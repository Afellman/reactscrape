# Floating Rocks

Simple app made with ReactJS to display the astroids that are orbiting earth on a given date. The data comes from directly from Nasa's open APIs which is then represented by my first attempt at playing with HTML 5 Canvas. The default date is today.

The speed and size of the astroids are relative to each other but not the earth. Their distances are reletive to the earth (by size scale) except for the furthest of them away which I had to bring closer so they fit on the screen. Even so, some astroids will fly off the screen, or be gone completely. This is a common problem when dealing with things on an astronomical scale.
